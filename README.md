## Overview

Port Scan Lab is a defensive analysis lab tool that parses firewall logs, groups connection attempts by source IP, and detects port scanning patterns: wide port sweeps, mixed-service reconnaissance, and rapid scan windows. Outputs include scan findings, per-source risk tables, a Markdown timeline report, and analyst triage handoff.

## Features

- Parses common firewall log formats
- Detects wide-range port scans
- Identifies mixed-service reconnaissance (web + SSH + DB ports)
- Detects rapid scan windows (compact time bursts)
- Scores risk per source IP
- Outputs JSON findings, source risk table, Markdown timeline report, and triage handoff

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- No third-party Python packages (standard library only)
- Optional: Docker for the demo container

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUDARSHANCHAUDHARI/PortScanLab.git
cd PortScanLab
pip install .
```

This registers the `port-scan-lab` CLI command.

To run without installing:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
```

## Usage

Analyze the included sample firewall logs:

```bash
python3 main.py --out reports/report.md
```

Generated outputs in `reports/`:

- `events.json` — parsed firewall events
- `findings.json` — detected scan findings
- `source-risk.json` — per-source risk table
- `summary.json` — counts and severity breakdown
- `report.md` — Markdown timeline report
- `triage.md` — analyst triage checklist

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Docker Demo

```bash
docker compose run --rm port-scan-demo
```

## Safe Use

This project is defensive and analysis-focused. Use only with logs and lab environments you own or have explicit written permission to assess. The included sample logs are synthetic and safe for public demo use.

## Status

Working CLI MVP with tests, sample data, and Docker support.

## Roadmap

- Live `iptables` log tailing mode
- Sigma rule import for scan signatures
- Per-protocol scan profile classification
- Allowlist for trusted scanners (internal vuln scans)
- GitHub release `v0.1.0-mvp`

## About

I'm Sudarshan Chaudhari, a Senior Quality Engineer, Test Automation specialist, and AI systems builder based in Bangkok, Thailand.

I have 13+ years of experience in software quality engineering, working across SaaS, fintech, gaming, web, mobile, cloud, and digital signage platforms. My background combines hands-on test automation with QA leadership, test strategy, CI/CD, release quality, production investigation, and cross-platform validation.

Alongside my professional QA career, I run [SudarshanTechLabs](https://sudarshantechlabs.com/), my independent engineering and product lab where I design, build, test, and ship software across Android, web, AI, cybersecurity, developer tooling, and cross-platform applications.

### What I work on

- ⚙️ **Quality Engineering & Test Automation** — Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Appium, API testing, automation frameworks, end-to-end testing, CI/CD, release gates, GitHub Actions, risk-based testing, and production validation
- 🤖 **AI Systems & Automation** — AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, MCP servers, AI-assisted QA, prompt tooling, developer workflows, automation systems, and Claude Code plugins
- 📱 **Mobile & Cross-Platform Applications** — Android applications built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Google Play releases, automated build and publishing pipelines, and cross-platform development spanning iOS, web, Windows, and macOS
- 🌐 **Web Applications & Platforms** — Full-stack applications using Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, Cloudflare, REST APIs, and modern web infrastructure
- 🛠️ **Developer Tooling & CLI Engineering** — Rust, Python, TypeScript, CLI utilities, multi-repository tooling, build automation, release tooling, and engineering productivity systems
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Observability** — Threat detection, log analysis, security auditing, vulnerability assessment, monitoring, and security-focused developer tools
- 📺 **Digital Signage & Device Platforms** — Content validation, playback testing, device compatibility, production investigation, monitoring, and QA across diverse hardware and operating-system environments

My work sits at the intersection of quality engineering, automation, AI, and software development. I approach products with a QA mindset from the beginning: understanding failure modes, designing for testability, automating repetitive work, and building release confidence into the engineering process.

Through SudarshanTechLabs, I also build products and tools from idea to production, covering architecture, development, testing, CI/CD, release automation, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance.
